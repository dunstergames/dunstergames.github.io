# Dunster Games
This website will list the games created by the Dunsters!

Most of these games will be made in [Microsoft MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com).
They will be tested on the [KittenBot Meowbit](https://www.kittenbot.cc/products/meowbit-codable-console-for-microsoft-makecode-arcade) but the games can also be run on most devices in a modern browser.
